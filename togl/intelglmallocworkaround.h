// intelglmallocworkaround.h
//  class responsible for setting up a malloc override that zeroes allocated 
//  memory of less than 96 bytes. this is to work around a bug
//  in the Intel GLSL compiler on Mac OS X 10.8 due to uninitialized memory.
//  
//  96 was chosen due to this quote from Apple: 
//    "I verified that the size of the structure is exactly 64 bytes on 10.8.3, 10.8.4 and will be on 10.8.5."
//
//  certain GLSL shaders would (intermittently) cause a crash the first time they
//  were drawn, and the bug has supposedly been fixed in 10.9, but is unlikely to
//  ever make it to 10.8.
